     <h4>ABOUT MY PASSION</h4>
     <p>We often hear the word Passion,but have never thought or tried to understand in depth about it.
        We all have an inner liking to certain kind of art or act,that really drives us crazy and  We
        love doing it.We never get tired or bored while being in such kind of act.When you do something 
        you love,you would never get tired of sharpening your skills and getting the best out of you and
        for others.My passion is Web Developer and fashion.I became interested because i enjoy the web. I spend a lot
        of time online and i'am excited about it and what it can do,and I like being able to contribute to
        that.I get satisfication out of this whole process of assembling these things that can usually be
        accessed by people around the world on a variety of devices,and constantly learning better ways to
        do it.
        Six WONDERS THAT DROVE MY PASSION TOWARD DESIGNING:
        1.Switching Things
        2.Everyday Experiments
        3.Engaging in Personal Projects
        4.Everyday Learning Sessions
        5.Play Around with Logics
        6.Growing Market and Increasing Competition</p>
      <p>My another passion is Fashion."Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only.Fashion is in the 
        sky,in the street;fashion has to do with ideas,the way we live,what is happening".People use fashion 
        to express themselves everyday and to show who they are.Fashion is something that allows people to be 
        creative,bold,dramatic,and beautiful.When I look around at the thousands of people I pass by every day,
        I see a variety of styles.I see people wearing clothes that are "in" or the "new style" I also see others
        wearing their own creative,interesting styles.Someday I hope to be a fashion designer so I can express
        myself through fashion better than I do today.I hope that I will use my inspirations and personality to 
        create new  styles that many will love.Fashion is also important to me because I can be who i want to be 
        through it.I don't have to or choose to dress like everyone else,because then I would'nt be me.I dislike 
        copying everyone else and being just like them.
               Personal style is at its best when it brings out your best qualities that makes you look and feel
        the best inside and out.Having your own bold,creative style can give you the confidence to get through 
        every day."THE BEST COLOR IN THE WHOLE WORLD IS THE ONE THAT LOOKS BEST ON YOU".</p>
         <h6>THE BEST PREPARATION FOR TOMORROW IS DOING YOUR BEST TODAY</h6>
